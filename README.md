Collaborative Strategies
  Coding was completed using a single device, swapping between one team member coding, and the other standing by to help by looking up methods, classes, and providing guidance on the code.
  Development beegan with establishing the main game loop. By using a while loop, the game is able to run continuously until the player enters the correct number. Additionally, the group
  elected to add a function giving the player hints, allowing them to narrow their guesses down until the right answer was guessed. After establishing the main game loop, the group wanted to
  account for possible input errors. To this end, a type handling loop was added to the game loop. This allows the program to account for input's that are not integers.

Pair Programming
  Pair programming allowed the group to focus on two aspects of the game's development at once. For example, while the initial game loop was being coded, the group member not coding 
  was able to develop ideas and plan out the type handler loop. Time was allocated to planning ideas prior to coding, contirubting to the quality of the program.
