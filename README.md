Collaborative Strategies
  Coding was completed using a single device, swapping between one team member coding, and the other standing by to help by looking up methods, classes, and providing guidance on the code.
  Development beegan with establishing the main game loop. By using a while loop, the game is able to run continuously until the player enters the correct number. Additionally, the group
  elected to add a function giving the player hints, allowing them to narrow their guesses down until the right answer was guessed. After establishing the main game loop, the group wanted to
  aacount for possible input errors. To this end, a type handling loop was added to the game loop. This allows the program to account for input's that are not integers.
